# Stated baseline agreement for collective decision making
Version 1

The signing entity is identified by the “author” field value in the referencing digital PDF signature using the stated system and is in the following part referred to as “user”. <br />
The relevant domain owned by the user is identified by the “domain” field value is referred to as “users domain” in the following part. <br />
No jurisdiction is chosen for this contract. It is solely enforced by the collection of signatories to this contract. <br />

## 1. Stated enforced commitments
Commitments contained in statements and in files which are signed using the “Sign PDF” statement  type are classified as “Stated enforced commitments”, if they are clearly labeled as such.
These should be outlined with objective compliance criteria and time frames. A time interval for publishing supporting evidence for commitment compliance should be specified if applicable.

For any stated enforced commitments in statements that satisfy all of the following criteria:
- the statement is distributed in the majority of active nodes in the stated network 
- the “domain” field equals the users domain
- the “author” field equals the user as defined above
- the statement has not been provably revoked through a public channel within ~7 days (168 hours) of publication of the statement

In the event of failing to meet any contained stated enforced commitments, the user agrees to do the following: <br />
- pay a penalty of 100 USD (unless specified) to the following arbitrarily chosen non profit organization which solely functions as a benign money sink to facilitate penalty payment: Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. (WMF).
- publish a proof of payment with reference to the commitment
- the user does not need to pay more that the maximum of 500 USD penalty within a 12 month period in case of multiple commitment failures

The user understands that it is essential to monitor of the existence of any widely distributed statements which were wrongly made in their name under their domain, in order to avoid damage caused by fraudulent impersonation of the user.

The user understands that it is essential to carefully control the access to the relevant server resources and domain registrar login information to prevent accidental and malicious impersonation by unauthorized employees or other parties.


## 2. P2P enforcement of commitment failures in conjunction with penalty payment failures
The user agrees to enforce the terms of this agreement applied to any other verified entity who signed this agreement by implementing the following action plan:
1. They will randomly sample commitments made by other entities, review supporting evidence and act on identified commitment failures without penalty proof.
2. They will warn any signatory once they determine a breach of term 1 or 2 of this agreement unless they have been demonstrably warned already and communicate to the network that they determined this breach.
3. If the majority nodes agree that the entity in question violated term 1 or 2 of this agreement, the user will stop transmitting statements authored by the violating entity after a grace period of 90 days after the warning until the entity complies.
