# Meta intelligence

Intelligence arising from many intelligent units.<br />
Humanity acting as a unit, making decisions in near real time, can be viewed as a meta intelligence.<br />
If an alien civilisation would like to negotiate with humanity, they could use a variant of this interface.<br />
The input / output would mimic that of a human.<br />
If the aliens ask a question, _it_ may decide to respond.<br />
If the aliens try to deceive, _it_ may realize and get angry.<br />
