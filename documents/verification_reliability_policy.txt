Domain verification reliability policy.

For all verifications published by us with confidence rating = 1.0,
100 EUR will be awarded to any entity that
is the first to prove, that at the time of the verification publication
any of the following conditions were met:
1. the verified organisation did not directly or indirectly have the rightful control the referenced domain name
2. the verified organisation was falsely associated with data points of a company with a very similar name
3. the verified organisation did not exist

This does not apply to verifications which have been disputed / superseded or removed by us before the proof has been provided.
This also does not apply to data points which were correct previously and have only been outdated for less than 13 months.
For information which is shared publicly with a certain delay, such as employee counts in annual reports, this delay is subtracted,
for determining the duration of data being outdated.

The statement existence monitoring data from third party stated nodes can provide proof of the publication times of
verifications and statements providing evidence for false information.

For verifications with a confidence rating smaller than 1.0, it also needs to be demonstrated that the confidence ratings are too high.
So enough false verifications need to be refuted among the set of all verifications with the same confidence rating from the same author,
such that ((correct verifications) / (all verifications)) is smaller than the proclaimed confidence rating.

This policy is restricted to verification statements published via the same domain and under the same author as
this domain verification reliability policy.
We are not liable for any resulting damages.
