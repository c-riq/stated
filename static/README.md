Static text file publishing is cheaper and easier to maintain than running a server with a full stated p2p node (which also verifies, re-transmitts and aggregates other parties statements).

### Components
- Instructions how to publish statements using Github Pages hosting
- Terraform files to setup cloud infrastructure (AWS, work in progress)
- Scripts for generating statement text files locally
- Scripts for deploying statements
