### Development

Make sure nodejs is installed: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ . <br/>
In the root directory of the project, run:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

### Deployment

```sh
npm run build
```

This will copy frontend build files into backend/public/ directory so it can deployed together with the API on the server.
